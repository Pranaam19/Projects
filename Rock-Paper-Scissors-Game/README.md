# Rock-Paper-Scissors 

Rock, paper, scissors is a great coding project for beginners because it teaches the basics of programming, such as:

* Conditional statements: Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program based on different conditions. For example, in the rock, paper, scissors game, you need to use conditional statements to determine the winner of the game.

* Random numbers: Random numbers can be used to add an element of chance to your games. For example, in the rock, paper, scissors game, you can use a random number generator to determine the computer's choice.

Rock, paper, scissors is a hand game with two players, each of whom simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended).

The game is played by both players forming one of the three shapes at the same time, then revealing their choices. The winner is determined by the following rules:

* Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)
* Scissors beats paper (scissors cuts paper)
* Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)
* If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie.
